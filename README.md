# Dell-Inspiron-15-7559 OPENCORE 0.6.5  
# windows10 and Big Sur dual booting OK
# Most of them work well
# This setting works well for me. I think I'll need it in the future, so I save it.
# I changed only the LAN card from the previous one to bcm94352z.
# If you want to use hdmi, you need to replace the current setting of smbios MacBook Pro 13.3 with 13.1.
# The hdmi needs to connect the cable after osx boots completely. It does not work from boot time.
# The reason why I can set it up to here is because of you who shared 7559 opencore data. I heartily thank you.
